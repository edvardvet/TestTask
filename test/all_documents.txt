Below are the common settings you will come across when using different LLM providers: Temperature - In short, the lower the temperature , the more deterministic the results in the sense that the highest probable next token is always picked. Increasing temperature could lead to more randomness, which encourages more diverse or creative outputs. You are essentially increasing the weights of the other possible

In terms of application, you might want to use a lower temperature value for tasks like fact-based QA to encourage more factual and concise responses. For poem generation or other creative tasks, it might be beneficial to increase the temperature value. Top P - A sampling technique with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where you can control how deterministic the model is. If you are looking for exact and factual answers keep this low. If

If you use Top P it means that only the tokens comprising the top_p probability mass are considered for responses, so a low top_p value selects the most confident responses. This means that a high top_p value will enable the model to look at more possible words, including less likely ones, leading to more diverse outputs. The general recommendation is to alter temperature or

Specifying a max length helps you prevent long or irrelevant responses and control costs. Stop Sequences - A stop sequence is a string that stops the model from generating tokens. Specifying stop sequences is another way to control the length and structure of the model's response. For example, you can tell the model to generate

  Content: For example, you can tell the model to generate lists that have no more than 10 items by adding "11" as a stop sequence. Frequency Penalty - The frequency penalty applies a penalty on the next token proportional to how many times that token already appeared in the response and prompt. The higher the frequency penalty, the less likely a word will appear again. This setting reduces the repetition of words in the model's response by giving tokens that appear more a higher penalty. Presence Penalty

Presence Penalty - The presence penalty also applies a penalty on repeated tokens but, unlike the frequency penalty, the penalty is the same for all repeated tokens. A token that appears twice and a token that appears 10 times are penalized the same. This setting prevents the model from repeating phrases too often in its response. If you want the model to generate diverse or creative text, you might want to use a higher presence penalty. Or, if you need the model

The system message is not required but helps to set the overall behavior of the assistant. The example above only includes a user message which you can use to directly prompt the model. For simplicity, all of the examples,

In fact, this basic example highlights the necessity to provide more context or instructions on what specifically you want to achieve with the system. This is what prompt engineering is all about. Let's try to improve it a bit: Prompt: Complete the sentence: The sky is Output: blue during the day and dark at night. Is

Well, with the prompt above you are instructing the model to complete the sentence so the result looks a lot better as it follows exactly what you told it to do ("complete the sentence"). This approach of designing effective prompts to instruct the model to perform a desired task is what's referred to as prompt engineering in this guide.

  Content: like the above, it's also referred to as zero-shot prompting , i.e., you are directly prompting the model for a response without any examples or demonstrations about the task you want it to achieve. Some large language models have the ability to perform zero-shot prompting but it depends on the complexity and knowledge of the task at hand and the tasks the model was trained to perform good on. A concrete prompt example is as follows: Prompt Q: What is prompt engineering? With some of the more

  Content: with designing prompts, you should keep in mind that it is really an iterative process that requires a lot of experimentation to get optimal results. Using a simple playground from OpenAI or Cohere is a good starting point. You can start with simple prompts and keep adding more elements and context as you aim for better results. Iterating your prompt along the way is vital for this reason. As you read the guide, you will see many examples where specificity, simplicity, and conciseness will

  Content: specificity, simplicity, and conciseness will often give you better results. When you have a big task that involves many different subtasks, you can try to break down the task into simpler subtasks and keep building up as you get better results. This avoids adding too much complexity to the prompt design process at the beginning. The Instruction You can design effective prompts for various simple tasks by using commands to instruct the model what you want to achieve, such as "Write",

Try different instructions with different keywords, contexts, and data and see what works best for your particular use case and task. Usually, the more specific and relevant the context is to the task you are trying to perform, the better. We will touch on the importance of sampling and adding more context in the

Another recommendation is to use some clear separator like "###" to separate the instruction and context. For instance: Prompt: ### Instruction ### Translate the text below to Spanish: Text: "hello!" Output: ¡Hola! Specificity Be very specific about the instruction and task you want the model to perform. The more descriptive and detailed the prompt is, the

  Content: (opens in a new tab) Question Answering One of the best ways to get the model to respond with specific answers is to improve the format of the prompt. As covered before, a prompt could combine instructions, context, input, and output indicators to get improved results. While these components are not required, it becomes a good practice as the more specific you are with instruction, the better results you will get. Below is an example of how this would look following a more structured prompt.

The example below shows how powerful LLMs can be with a little more effort in designing the prompts. Prompt: """ Table departments, columns = [DepartmentId, DepartmentName] Table students, columns = [DepartmentId, StudentId, StudentName] Create a MySQL query for all students in the Computer Science Department """ Output: SELECT StudentId,

In this case, you provided data about the database schema and asked it to generate a valid MySQL query. Reasoning Perhaps one of the most difficult tasks for an LLM today is one that requires some form of reasoning. Reasoning is one of most interesting areas due to the types of complex

The zero-shot prompt directly instructs the model to perform a task without any additional examples to steer it. We tried a few zero-shot examples in the previous section. Here is one of the examples (ie., text classification) we used: Prompt: Classify the text into neutral, negative or positive. Text: I think the vacation is okay. Sentiment: Output: Neutral

This is what's referred to as prompt chaining, where a task is split into subtasks with the idea to create a chain of prompt operations. Prompt chaining is useful to accomplish complex tasks which an LLM might struggle to address if prompted with a very detailed prompt. In prompt chaining, chain prompts perform transformations or

RAG can be fine-tuned and its internal knowledge can be modified in an efficient manner and without needing retraining of the entire model. RAG takes an input and retrieves a set of relevant/supporting documents given a source (e.g., Wikipedia). The documents are concatenated as context with the original input prompt and fed to the text

This is very useful as LLMs's parametric knowledge is static. RAG allows language models to bypass retraining, enabling access to the latest information for generating reliable outputs via retrieval-based generation. Lewis et al., (2021) proposed a general-purpose fine-tuning recipe for RAG. A pre-trained seq2seq model is used as the

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) (opens in a new tab) and ReAct (opens in a new tab) are used as Actor models. A memory component is also added to provide additional context to the agent. An Evaluator : Scores outputs produced by the Actor. Concretely, it takes

  Content: produced by the Actor. Concretely, it takes as input a generated trajectory (also denoted as short-term memory) and outputs a reward score. Different reward functions are used depending on the task (LLMs and rule-based heuristics are used for decision-making tasks). Self-Reflection : Generates verbal reinforcement cues to assist the Actor in self-improvement. This role is achieved by an LLM and provides valuable feedback for future trials. To generate specific and relevant feedback, which is

  Content: generate specific and relevant feedback, which is also stored in memory, the self-reflection model makes use of the reward signal, the current trajectory, and its persistent memory. These experiences (stored in long-term memory) are leveraged by the agent to rapidly improve decision-making. In summary, the key steps of the Reflexion process are a) define a task, b) generate a trajectory, c) evaluate, d) perform reflection, and e) generate the next trajectory. The figure below demonstrates

The functions that are being called by function calling will act as tools in your AI application and you can define more than one in a single request. Function calling is an important ability for building LLM-powered chatbots or

  Content: Function Calling with GPT-4 As a basic example, let's say we asked the model to check the weather in a given location. The LLM alone would not be able to respond to this request because it has been trained on a dataset with a cutoff point. The way to solve this is to combine the LLM with an external tool. You can leverage the function calling capabilities of the model to determine an external function to call along with its arguments and then have it return a final response. Below is a simple

Let's say a user is asking the following question to the model: What is the weather like in London? To handle this request using function calling, the first step is to define a weather function or set of functions that you will be passing as part of the OpenAI API request: tools = [ { "type" : "function" , "function" : { "name" : "get_current_weather" , "description" : "Get the current

Coherence and relevance are other natural language generation challenges. To tackle the diversity issue, the authors prepared a vocabulary of around 1500 basic words, mirroring a typical child's vocabulary,

  Content: this section, we will cover many examples of how to use ChatGPT for code generation. The OpenAI's Playground (Chat Mode) and the gpt-3.5-turbo model are used for all examples below. As with all chat models from OpenAI, you can use a System Message to define the behavior and format of the responses. We will use the following System Message for the prompt examples: You are a helpful code assistant that can teach a junior developer how to code. Your language of choice is Python. Don't explain the

Topics: ChatGPT Introduction Reviewing The Conversation Task Conversations with ChatGPT ChatGPT Introduction ChatGPT is a new model trained by OpenAI (opens in a new tab) that has the capability to interact in a conversational way. This model is trained to follow instructions in a prompt to provide appropriate responses in the context of a dialogue. ChatGPT can help with answering questions,

ChatGPT is trained using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). While this model is a lot more capable than previous GPT iterations (and also trained to reduce harmful and untruthful outputs), it still comes with limitations. Let's cover some of the capabilities and limitations with concrete examples. You can use the research preview of ChatGPT here but

Reviewing The Conversation Task In one of the previous guides, we covered a bit about conversation capabilities and role prompting. We covered how to instruct the LLM to have a conversation in a specific style, with a specific intent, behavior, and identity. Let's review our previous basic example where we created a conversational system that's able to generate more

Human: Can you tell me about the creation of black holes? AI: From the example above, you can see two important components: the intent or explanation of what the chatbot is the identity which

More recently, OpenAI announced the ChatGPT APIs (opens in a new tab) , which is a more powerful and cheaper model called gpt-3.5-turbo was specifically built for this type of functionality (chat completions). In fact, OpenAI recommends this as their best model even for non-chat use cases. Other

The model expects a series of messages as input and uses those to generate a response. Input: SYSTEM: You are an AI research assistant. You use a tone that is technical and scientific. USER: Hello, who are you? ASSISTANT: Greeting! I am an AI research assistant. How can I help you today? USER: Can you tell me about the

  Content: I help you today? USER: Can you tell me about the creation of black holes? Output: ASSISTANT: Of course! Black holes are created when a massive star runs out of fuel and collapses under its own gravity. This collapse causes the star to become incredibly dense, with a gravitational field so strong that not even light can escape it. This point of no return is known as the event horizon. Once a star crosses the event horizon, it is considered a black hole... Note that in the example above, I have

  Content: Llama is a family of large language models (LLM), released by Meta, with the capabilities to accept text prompts and generate and discuss code. The release also includes two other variants (Code Llama Python and Code Llama Instruct) and different sizes (7B, 13B, 34B, and 70B). In this prompting guide, we will explore the capabilities of Code Llama and how to effectively prompt it to accomplish tasks such as code completion and debugging code. We will be using the Code Llama 70B Instruct hosted

Here's the science behind it: Sunlight is made up of different colors of light, like red, green, blue, and violet. When sunlight hits the Earth's atmosphere, the different colors of light scatter in different directions. Blue light scatters more easily than other colors because it has shorter wavelengths. The scattered blue light travels in all directions, including towards your

The string "JSON" must appear in the system message for this functionality to work. Reproducible Outputs Chat Completions are non-deterministic by default. However, OpenAI now offers some control towards deterministic outputs by giving the user access to the seed parameter and the system_fingerprint response field.

It is helpful for cases where the user wants to call multiple functions in one turn. For example, users may want to call functions to get the weather in 3 different locations at the same time. In this case, the model will call multiple functions in a single response. Common Use Cases Function calling allows you to more

  Content: as Mistral 7B (opens in a new tab) but the main difference is that each layer in Mixtral 8x7B is composed of 8 feedforward blocks (i.e,. experts). Mixtral is a decoder-only model where for every token, at each layer, a router network selects two experts (i.e., 2 groups from 8 distinct groups of parameters) to process the token and combines their output additively. In other words, the output of the entire MoE module for a given input is obtained through the weighted sum of the outputs produced

  Content: through the weighted sum of the outputs produced by the expert networks. Given that Mixtral is an SMoE, it has a total of 47B parameters but only uses 13B per token during inference. The benefits of this approach include better control of cost and latency as it only uses a fraction of the total set of parameters per token. Mixtral was trained with open Web data and a context size of 32 tokens. It is reported that Mixtral outperforms Llama 2 80B with 6x faster inference and matches or
